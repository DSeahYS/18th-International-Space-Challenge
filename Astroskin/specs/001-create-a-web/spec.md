## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a mission controller, I want to visualize real-time and historical astronaut biometrics from Astroskin/Bio-Monitor during IVA/EVA, including high-rate waveforms and 1 Hz vitals, with clear alerting and drill-downs for diagnostics, so that I can detect anomalies within 1-2 seconds without false positives while maintaining multi-stream context for hours without fatigue.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** real-time data is streaming at 1 Hz for vitals and high rates for waveforms, **When** an anomaly is detected (e.g., SpO2 < 95%), **Then** the system displays a critical alert with hypothesis (e.g., "Hypoxia detected") and jump link to the relevant time window within 1-2 seconds.
2. **Given** the dashboard is loaded in Mission Overview mode, **When** the user presses and holds on a waveform for diagnostic loupe, **Then** a 10-second magnified window appears with toggles for raw/filtered views and 50/60 Hz notch filters, snapping back on release.
3. **Given** an alert is triggered, **When** the user clicks the jump link, **Then** the timeline scrubs to the event time and cross-filters all charts to show correlated signals (e.g., motion artifact ‚Üí ECG dropouts).

### Edge Cases
- What happens when data stream drops for a channel? The system degrades gracefully, showing "data unavailable" states with time-aligned placeholders and explicit indicators.
- How does system handle high-frequency artifacts during motion? Artifacts are flagged with red overlays, and causality trails link them to confidence metrics in derived calculations.
- What if multiple alerts occur simultaneously? The system groups by episode, deduplicates repeats, and stacks toasts in the persistent alert rail.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display real-time vitals at 1 Hz: heart rate, breathing rate, SpO2, skin temperature, blood pressure, with per-sensor signal quality and battery state.
- **FR-002**: System MUST render high-rate waveforms: ECG at 256 Hz, thoracic and abdominal respiration at 128 Hz each, 3-axis accelerometer at 64 Hz per axis, with artifact flags and stream health indicators.
- **FR-003**: System MUST show derived and events: RR intervals, HRV ranges (server-computed), minute ventilation, activity intensity, inspiration/expiration markers, and step events.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide two layout modes: Mission Overview (12-col grid, responsive breakpoints at 1440/1280/1024) and Diagnostic Lab (free-width canvas with dockable panels).
- **FR-005**: System MUST include a persistent alert rail with stackable toasts for severity, cause hypothesis, and jump links to time windows.
- **FR-006**: System MUST support a session timeline scrubber with event markers for exercise, sleep, EVA segments, and gaps, enabling cross-filtering of all linked charts.
- **FR-007**: System MUST offer a data quality widget displaying per-channel SNR/lock and battery with thresholds tuned to Astroskin sampling behavior.
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement interaction patterns: press-and-hold diagnostic loupe for 10-second magnification with filter toggles (raw vs filtered, 50/60 Hz notch), causality trail node strips linking alerts to upstream signals, and one-tap timeline remixes for Exercise, Sleep, EVA, and Baseline with context-specific color emphasis and thresholds.
- **FR-009**: System MUST use the AstroTelemetry design system: Cislunar Noir color palette, Inter typography, minimal outline icons, 4/8 base spacing, and specified component styles for waveform canvases, vitals tiles, alert banners, timeline scrubbers, and data quality widgets.
- **FR-010**: System MUST meet accessibility standards: WCAG AA/AAA for dark and light modes, dysrhythmia-friendly color alternates, and monochrome failsafe with pattern encodings for status.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Sensor**: Represents a biometric sensor channel (e.g., ECG, respiration thoracic), with attributes: type, sampling rate, signal quality, battery level, SNR.
- **Vital Measurement**: Represents 1 Hz vital signs, with attributes: type (HR, BR, SpO2, temp, BP), value, timestamp, status (normal/caution/critical).
- **Waveform Data**: Represents high-rate signal streams, with attributes: sensor type, data points array, timestamp range, artifacts list.
- **Alert**: Represents anomaly detection, with attributes: severity, cause hypothesis, timestamp, linked sensors, episode ID.
- **Session Segment**: Represents mission periods, with attributes: type (EVA, sleep, exercise), start/end timestamps, event markers.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: System MUST handle 256 Hz ECG, 128 Hz respiration, and 64 Hz accelerometer rendering without frame drops; chart updates MUST occur within 150 ms; system MUST support 24/7 operation in mission control consoles.
- **Accessibility**: System MUST meet WCAG AA/AAA for both dark and light modes; MUST provide dysrhythmia-friendly color alternates and a monochrome failsafe with pattern encodings for status.
- **Resilience**: System MUST degrade gracefully if a channel drops, displaying explicit "data unavailable" states and time-aligned placeholders; MUST not flash above 3 Hz.
- **Usability**: System MUST enable anomaly recognition within 1-2 seconds with minimal false positives; MUST maintain multi-stream context readable for hours without fatigue in mixed lighting.

### Integration Requirements
- System MUST integrate with Astroskin/Bio-Monitor data streams for real-time and historical astronaut biometrics.
- System MUST receive derived computations (HRV ranges, minute ventilation) from server-side processing.
- System MUST support data assumptions: ECG 256 Hz, respiration 128 Hz, accelerometer 64 Hz, vitals 1 Hz, with realistic ranges and artifacts.

# Neural Jacobian Field

This is the code for **Unifying 3D Representation and Control of Diverse Robots with a Single Camera** by Sizhe Lester Li, Annan Zhang, Boyuan Chen, Hanna Matusik, Chao Liu, Daniela Rus, and Vincent Sitzmann

## News
- [12/03/2024] We will release a cleaner, type-checked implementation in two weeks. Stay tuned!


## Installation

```bash
conda create --name neural-jacobian-field python=3.9.18
conda activate neural-jacobian-field

cd project
bash install.sh
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

## Acquiring Datasets

Neural Jacobian Fields was trained with our own multi-view robot dataset. Our dataset includes a pneumatic robot hand (mounted on a robot arm), the Allegro robot hand, the Handed Shearing Auxetics platform, and the Poppy robot arm.

We plan to release all our robot data to encourage future research endeavors.

**(09/20/2024) We are actively working on uploading our dataset to the web. Updates on this coming very soon!** Feel free to contact sizheli@mit.edu if you need the dataset urgently.

## Acquiring Pre-trained Checkpoints

You can find pre-trained checkpoints [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fq0nngkeRWhCJ_CAyzQopYda20Zu-Zu8?usp=sharing). Directory `model_checkpoints` needs to be placed in the root directory for inference examples (.ipynb files) to run correctly.

## Running the Code

### Training

The main entry point is `project/neural_jacobian_field/train.py`. Call it via:

```bash
python3 -m neural_jacobian_field.train \
training.data.batch_size=6 training.data.num_workers=16 dataset=toy_arm \
model=toy_arm model.train_flow=false model.train_encoder=true
```

To reduce memory usage, you can change the batch size as follows:

```bash
python3 -m neural_jacobian_field.train training.data.batch_size=1 "...all other flags"
```

Our code supports multi-GPU training. The above batch size is the per-GPU batch size.

### Evaluation

- [Visualize Jacobian Fields] `notebooks/1_visualize_jacobian_fields.ipynb`
- [Inverse Dynamics Optimization] `notebooks/2_inverse_dynamics_optimization.ipynb`
- [Robot Experiment] `Coming soon!`

## Camera Conventions

Our extrinsics are OpenCV-style camera-to-world matrices. This means that +Z is the camera look vector, +X is the camera right vector, and -Y is the camera up vector. Our intrinsics are normalized, meaning that the first row is divided by image width, and the second row is divided by image height.

# Project AURA MVP Website Specification

## Primary Goal
The primary goal of the MVP is to create a compelling, single-page website that effectively communicates the vision, core features, and technological ambition of Project AURA. It should serve as a high-impact digital brochure to generate interest and showcase the project's concept.

## Key Sections for the MVP Website

### Hero Section
**Objective:** Immediately capture the visitor's attention.

**Content:** A powerful headline, a concise tagline summarizing Project AURA's purpose (e.g., "A symbiotic AI partner for deep space autonomy"), and a visually stunning background image or animation that evokes space exploration and advanced technology.

### The Vision: Why Project AURA?
**Objective:** Explain the problem the project solves.

**Content:** Briefly describe the challenges of long-duration space missions, emphasizing communication latency and the need for astronaut autonomy. This section sets the stage for the solutions that follow.

### Core Features Explained
**Objective:** Detail the key functionalities of the AURA system in an easy-to-understand format.

**Content:** Dedicate a subsection to each of the five core requirements:

- **Sovereign AI Brain**
- **Adaptive AR/XR Visual Interface**
- **Closed-Loop Biometric Monitoring**
- **Adaptive Contingency Engineering (ACE) Module**
- **Embodied Kinematic Model (VPK)**

Use icons, short descriptions, and simple graphics to illustrate each component's role.

### Integrated System in Action
**Objective:** Show how the individual modules work together seamlessly.

**Content:** Use a step-by-step graphic or short animated narrative to walk through the "Summary Interaction Flow Example" provided in the project overview. This demonstrates the system's true value as an integrated, symbiotic partner. For example: Repair Task Begins -> Stress Detected -> System Adapts -> Component Breaks -> ACE Module Activates.

### Technology Showcase
**Objective:** Briefly highlight the technical feasibility and modern approach.

**Content:** A small section that lists the key technologies from the proposed website tech stack. This signals that the project is grounded in a solid technical foundation without overwhelming the visitor with details.

## MVP Technology Stack
The technology stack for the MVP website should prioritize performance, developer experience, and modern aesthetics. The previously recommended stack is ideal for this purpose.

| Component | Recommended Technology | Purpose in MVP |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| Framework | Next.js (with React) | Ensures a fast-loading, SEO-friendly site that can be easily expanded in the future. |
| Language | TypeScript | Helps build a stable and maintainable codebase from the start, reducing errors. |
| UI/Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Allows for rapid development of a custom, visually appealing design with high-quality, accessible UI components. |
| Hosting | Vercel or Netlify | Provides simple, fast, and free (for many starter projects) deployment with automatic builds and a global CDN. |
